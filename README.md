## ⚔️ Six Built-in Rules

| Rule | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **ALL** | All players who dealt damage receive **identical rewards**. |
| **PACK** | Randomly select **one player** among all who dealt damage to receive the reward. The more damage you dealt, the higher your chance! Selected players receive identical rewards. |
| **MULTI_PACK** | Randomly select **three players** to receive the reward. The more damage you dealt, the higher your chance! Selected players receive identical rewards. |
| **RANK** | The **top three damage dealers** receive rewards, and each rank gets a **different reward**. |
| **SEPATATE** | Every participant **has a chance** to receive rewards. Each reward has its own probability, increasing with the player’s damage dealt. Each reward roll is independent. <br>Example: A player with 80% of total damage has an 80% chance for each reward. |
| **SEPATATE_PACK** | Rewards are divided into **groups**, and one player is selected from each group. The chance depends on damage dealt. <br>Example: Player A (80% damage) and Player B (20%) have 80% and 20% chance respectively for that reward group. |
